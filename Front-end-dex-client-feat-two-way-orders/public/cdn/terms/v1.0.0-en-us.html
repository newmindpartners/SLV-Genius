    <h4>4. Your Representations and Warranties</h4>
    <p>
      Prior to your use of the Services and on an ongoing basis you represent, warrant,
      covenant, and agree that:
    </p>
    <p>
      4.1. There is a risk of losing cryptocurrency and other funds of value when using
      the Services and Genius Yield has no responsibility to you for any such loss;
    </p>
    <p>
      4.2. Your use of the Services is at your sole option, discretion, and risk. You
      hereby accept full responsibility for any consequences that may arise from your use
      of the Services, and expressly agree and acknowledge that Genius Yield shall have
      absolutely no liability in this regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.3. You are solely responsible for any applicable taxes which may be payable on
      cryptocurrency traded or transacted by you through your using the Services;
    </p>
    <p>
      4.4. Any cryptographic tokens, blockchain technology, or distributed ledger
      technology-related projects are new and relatively untested, and outside of both our
      and our Users’ exclusive control. Any adverse changes in market forces, technology,
      and regulatory environment impacting our performance under this Agreement shall
      absolve us from responsibility in this regard, including but not limited to hacking
      attacks, possible theft, unfavorable regulatory action, or unclear legal/tax status
      of cryptographic tokens.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.5. (i) You are eighteen years of age or older, (ii) you are of the age of majority
      in your jurisdiction, (iii) you are accessing the Services from a jurisdiction in

      applicable law, and at all times compliant with applicable law; and (v) you are
      solely responsible for use of the Services and, if applicable, for all activities
      that occur on or through your User account.
    </p>

    <h4>5. Assumption of Risks</h4>
    <p>
      By accessing and utilizing any of our Services, you represent and warrant that you
      possess adequate technical and financial knowledge to comprehend the inherent risks
      involved in using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems. You also acknowledge
      and understand the intricacies of digital assets, including but not limited to
      Cardano (ADA), stablecoins, and other digital tokens. You further acknowledge and
      understand that the markets for these digital assets are nascent and highly volatile
      due to factors such as adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation.
      You also acknowledge and understand that anyone can create a token, including fake
      versions of existing tokens and tokens that falsely claim to represent projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      You specifically acknowledge and accept the risks associated with such tokens and
      understand that so-called stablecoins may not be as stable as they purport to be,
      may not be fully or adequately collateralized, and may be subject to panics and
      runs. Moreover, you understand that smart contract transactions automatically
      execute and settle, and that blockchain-based transactions are irreversible once
      confirmed. You acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of transacting with
      cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, such as Cardano, are variable and may
      increase dramatically at any time. If you act as a liquidity provider to the
      protocol through the interface, you understand that your digital assets may lose
      some or all of their value while they are supplied to the protocol through the
      interface due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens in a trading pair or liquidity
      pool. In summary, you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for any of
      these variables or risks, do not own or control the protocol, and cannot be held
      liable for any resulting losses that you may incur while accessing or using any of
      our products. Accordingly, you understand and agree to assume full responsibility
      for all the risks of accessing and using the interface to interact with the
      protocol.
    </p>

    <h4>6. User Interface and Protocol</h4>
    <p>
      The User Interface (“UI”) is a web or mobile-based platform that facilitates access
      to a decentralized protocol on the Cardano Blockchain, which enables users to trade
      compatible digital assets (the “Protocol”). The UI is separate from the Protocol and
      is one of the methods, but not the sole means of accessing it. The Protocol is a
      decentralized peer-to-peer computer Services protocol that users can access to
      provide digital asset liquidity, trade Cardano tokens or tokens of other blockchains
      with other users, and perform other tasks. By using the Interface, you acknowledge
      that you are not engaging in the purchase or sale of digital assets from Genius
      Yield, and we do not operate any liquidity pools.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your use of the Protocol involves various significant risks, including, but not
      limited to, financial loss while digital assets are being supplied to the Protocol
      and financial loss due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens in a trading pair or
      liquidity pool. Genius Yield does not provide, own, or control the Protocol, which
      is run independently by smart contracts deployed on the Cardano blockchain. The
      Protocol does not constitute an account by which Genius Yield or any other third
      parties act as financial intermediaries or custodians. While the software code has
      undergone beta testing and continues to be improved by feedback from the developer
      community, open-source contributors and beta-testers, we cannot guarantee that there
      will be no bugs in the Protocol. Some upgrades and modifications to the Protocol
      could be proposed and potentially implemented via a community-driven process by
      holders of GENS, the Genius Yield token.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before using the Protocol, you should closely review the relevant documentation to
      make sure that you understand how the Protocol works and the risks of your use of
      the Protocol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traders’ fees for trades are generally credited to liquidity providers for the
      Protocol or Protocol owned liquidity. Genius Yield does not typically provide
      liquidity into Protocol liquidity pools, and liquidity providers are autonomous
      third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      To access the UI, you must use non-custodial wallet software that enables
      interaction with public blockchains. Your relationship with the non-custodial wallet
      provider is regulated by the applicable Terms of Services, including those of
      third-party wallets under this Agreement. Genius Yield does not have custody or
      control over the contents of your wallet, and we cannot retrieve or transfer its
      contents. By connecting your wallet to our interface, you accept to be bound by this
      Agreement and all of its incorporated terms.
    </p>

    <h4>7. Prohibited Uses and Termination</h4>
    <p>
      7.1. In connection with your use of the Genius Yield Services, and your interactions
      with other Users, and third parties you agree and represent you will not engage in
      any illegal, unauthorized, or improper activity, which are:
    </p>

      Yield Services, and (b) suspend or terminate your access to the Genius Yield
      Services, at any time, and from time to time, without notice to you in certain,
      limited circumstances described herein. You agree that we shall not be liable to you
      or any third party for any modification or termination of the Genius Yield Services,
      or suspension or termination of your access to the Genius Yield Services, except to
      the extent otherwise expressly set forth herein.

    <h4>9. No Fiduciary Duties</h4>

      on us. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you acknowledge and agree that we owe
      no fiduciary duties or liabilities to you or any other party, and to the extent any
      such duties or liabilities may exist at law or in equity, those duties and
      liabilities are irrevocably disclaimed, waived, and eliminated. You further agree
      that the only duties and obligations that we owe you are those expressly set out in

      11.1. The laws of Switzerland (with the exclusion of any rules that might lead to
      the use of any other law which is not the law of Switzerland) will govern the
      validity and construction of this Agreement, any separate agreement whereby we

      Agreement or such separate agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      11.2. You may not use the Services if you are located in, or are a citizen or
